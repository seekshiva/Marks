Marks is an interactive php-based web application that automatically manages all the heavy work of assorting the data obtained after each exam. Teachers get to spend quality time working on other useful works instead of having waste their time with mundane data entry work.

The app provides various means of assessing students performance in exams, and also shows the progress made by each student throughout the year.
